Project Governance
==================

Model
-----
Warden Core uses a maintainer-led governance model with open community input.

Roles
-----
- Maintainers: Review/merge PRs, make releases, triage issues.
- Contributors: Propose changes via PRs and RFCs.
- Users: File issues/feature requests and participate in discussions.

Decision Making
---------------
- Day-to-day: Maintainers decide by lazy consensus.
- Significant changes: RFCs in `docs/rfcs/`, open for public comment ≥7 days.
- Tie-breaker: Lead maintainer calls; rationale recorded in the RFC/PR.

Releases
--------
- SemVer for public APIs.
- Release notes in `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
- Security releases follow SECURITY.md.

Maintainers
-----------
- Listed in `MAINTAINERS` (update via PR).
