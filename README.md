## 🤖 Why Warden?

### The AI Paradox: The "Wild Horse" Analogy 🐎
In a world where coding is automated, developers face a new crisis: **Loss of Context.**
> "An AI-generated project is like a **Wild Horse (Yılkı Atı)**. It is incredibly fast and powerful, capable of building weeks of work in minutes. But without a skilled handler (**Seyis**), it becomes unmanageable. It may bolt in the wrong direction, refuse to scale, or become untrained over time."

Warden is that handler. It ensures you never lose the reins of your codebase, no matter how fast the AI runs.

### The Problem
AI coding assistants are powerful but prone to:
*   **Hallucinations:** Inventing non-existent APIs or libraries.
*   **Subtle Bugs:** Introducing edge cases that human reviewers miss.
*   **Security Flaws:** Hardcoding secrets or using unsafe patterns.
*   **Drift:** Deviating from established project architecture.

Warden provides the **"Verify-Loop"** mechanism to ensure every AI-generated change is validated against a rigorous set of rules.

## 🌍 Universal Language Support
Warden's **Engine** runs on Python/Rust, but it validates code in **any language**.

| Category | Supported Languages (Native) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mobile** | **Flutter (Dart)**, Swift, Kotlin, React Native |
| **Backend** | Python, **Go**, **Rust**, Node.js (TS/JS), Java |
| **Frontend** | React, Vue, Angular, HTML/CSS |
| **Scripting** | Shell (Bash), Lua, Perl |

> **Pro Tip:** Warden can orchestrate *existing* tools. Already using `very_good_analysis` for Flutter? Warden wraps it, giving it a unified interface and fixing capabilities.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. 🧠 AI-Native Integration (MCP & Hooks)
Warden is built to integrate directly with your AI Agent:
*   **Context Loading:** Automatically injects `.warden/AI_RULES.md` into every session via Claude `SessionStart` hooks.
*   **Protocol Enforcement:** Instructs AI agents to follow the **Plan -> Execute -> Verify** loop.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Provides JSON/SARIF reports that AI agents can read to self-correct.

### 2. ⚡ Offline-First Intelligence (New!)
Warden is built for resilience. Unlike SaaS tools that go dark without internet:
*   **Local Models:** Once models (e.g., Qwen) are cached, Warden works 100% offline.
*   **Network Resilience:** Automatically detects connection timeouts and switches to local cache instantly.
*   **Zero Latency:** No API round-trips for standard scans.

### 3. 🧠 Hybrid AI Engine (Dual-Tier)
Warden balances cost, privacy, and intelligence using a smart routing system:
*   **Fast Tier (Local):** Uses **Qwen 2.5-Coder** (via Ollama) for high-frequency tasks (parsing, linter filtering). **Free & Private.**
*   **Smart Tier (Cloud):** Routes only complex logic (security fixes, architecture audits) to **GPT-4o/Claude**.
*   **Result:** 90% cost reduction compared to pure cloud agents.

### 4. 🛡️ Core Validation Frames (Built-in)
Warden ships with 6 powerful core frames:
1.  **SecurityFrame:** Detects vulnerabilities (SQLi, Secrets, XSS).
2.  **ResilienceFrame:** Validates error handling and resilience logic.
3.  **ArchitecturalFrame:** Enforces project structure and clean code references.
4.  **SpecFrame (API Contract):** Extracts and compares API contracts (Consumer vs Provider).
5.  **ResilienceFrame:** Checks for retry/circuit-breaker patterns.
6.  **OrphanFrame:** Detects dead code and unreferenced assets.

### 5. 🧩 Warden Hub (Marketplace)
Need more power? Install specialized frames from the community:
*   **Fuzz Testing:** `warden install fuzz`
*   **Property Testing:** `warden install property`
*   **Load Testing:** `warden install stress`

### 6. 💅 Integrated Linter & Style
Warden acts as a central hub for code quality, integrating tools like `ruff` directly into its pipeline.

### 🧩 Frames Concept: Intelligence Adapters
Frames in Warden are not just plugins; they are **Intelligence Adapters** that drive dumb tools.
*   **The Problem:** Tools like `ruff`, `mypy`, or `dart analyze` are just execution engines. They don't know your business context.
*   **The Warden Frame:** Acts as a "Driver" that:
    1.  **Standardizes:** Unifies CLI arguments and JSON outputs across all tools.
    2.  **Contextualizes:** Decides if a finding matters based on Project Purpose.
    3.  **Elevates:** Turns a "Lint Error" into a "Security Finding" if relevant.

> **Philosophy:** `warden install python_lint` doesn't just install Ruff; it teaches Warden *how to use* Ruff intelligently.

### 🛡️ Defense-in-Depth Hierarchy
Warden sits at the top of the quality pyramid:

1.  **Linter Layer (Fastest):** `Ruff`, `Biome`, `Dart Analyze` (Syntax & Style)
2.  **Static Analysis (Deep):** `SonarQube`, `Snyk` (Vulnerabilities)
3.  **Warden Core (Guardian):** Context-Aware, Architectural, AI-Powered Protection.

**Pre-Analysis Strategy:** Warden detects your stack (e.g., "This is a Flutter Project") *before* defining the pipeline, ensuring zero wasted resources on irrelevant checks.

### 7. ✨ Warden Craftsman (New!)
Warden doesn't just find bugs; it acts as a **Senior Software Craftsman**. The Cleaning Phase (`code-simplifier`) analyzes your code for:
*   **Elegance:** Simplifying nested logic and removing redundant variables.
*   **Clarity:** Reducing cognitive load and improving readability.
*   **Modernization:** Suggesting modern language features (e.g., Python `f-strings`, `list comprehensions`).

*Try it yourself:*
```bash
warden scan examples/messy_code.py
```

### 8. 🚦 False Positive Management
Warden gives you granular control over what to check:
*   **Inline Suppression:** Use `# warden-ignore: rule-id` to suppress specific issues.
*   **Global Config:** Define suppressions in `.warden/suppressions.yaml`.
*   **File Exclusion:** Respects `.gitignore` and supports `.warden/ignore.yaml`.

### 9. 🧠 Structural Intelligence & Hygiene (New!)
Warden goes beyond code syntax; it understands your **Project Architecture**:
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Uses AI to identify structural flaws (e.g., redundant configuration files, orphaned directories) that static analysis misses.
*   **Smart Hygiene:** Automatically filters noise (`__pycache__`, `node_modules`) globally, ensuring AI focuses only on relevant code.
*   **One-Config Standard:** Enforces a single source of truth (`.warden/config.yaml`), preventing "Config Drift".

### 10. 🧠 Dynamic AI-Powered Rules (New!)
Warden reaches beyond static analysis patterns:
*   **Pure AI Rules:** Define rules using human language directives (e.g., "Check for race conditions in async loops"). No regex required.
*   **Context-Aware Loading:** Rules automatically activate based on your project's framework (FastAPI, React, etc.) and project type (Microservice, Library).
*   **Deep Logic Auditing:** Detects complex flaws like synchronization issues, circular dependencies, and resilience pattern violations.

### 11. 🧠 Hallucination Prevention (Suppression System)
AI analysis can sometimes produce "hallucinations" – findings that look like issues but are actually valid code patterns (false positives). Warden provides a dedicated **Suppression Phase** to filter these out.

**How it works:**
1.  **Generation:** Frames analyze code and may generate false positives (e.g., `stress-unclosed_file` on a managed stream).
2.  **Filtration:** Before reporting, Warden checks `.warden/rules/suppressions.yaml`.
3.  **Suppression:** If a finding matches a suppression rule, it is silently removed from the report.

**Configuration (`.warden/rules/suppressions.yaml`):**
```yaml
enabled: true
entries:
  - id: "suppress-stress-fp"        # Unique ID for the rule
    rules:
      - "stress-unclosed_file"      # The Finding ID to suppress (e.g. hallucination)
    file: "src/utils/stream.py"     # Specific file path
    reason: "Standard streams are managed by system"
```
> **Note:** Unlike `CustomRule`s which are *active* checks, Suppressions are *passive* filters that run at the very end of the pipeline.

### 12. 🛡️ Hybrid Analysis (Verification Phase)
Warden reduces false positives by implementing a "Trust but Verify" approach:
1.  **Fast Scan:** Static analysis (Regex/LSP) quickly identifies potential issues.
2.  **LLM Judge:** A specialized prompt acts as a "Senior Security Engineer", reviewing the finding against the code context.
3.  **Result:**
    -   **True Positives:** Passed to Fortification for fixing.
    -   **False Positives:** (e.g., Type Hints mistaken for arrays) are silently filtered out BEFORE consuming tokens on auto-fix generation.

### 13. 🎯 Intent-Driven Validation
Warden doesn't just check *correctness*; it checks *appropriateness*.
*   **The Concept:** A "hardcoded password" might be a critical vulnerability in a **Banking API**, but completely valid in a **Test Seeder**.
*   **How it Works:** Warden analyzes your project structure (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`) to detect intent (e.g., "This is a Crypto Wallet" vs "This is a CLI Tool").
*   **The Result:** Rules adjust dynamically:
    *   *Crypto Wallet:* 🛡️ Paranoid Mode (No http, strict types)
    *   *CLI Tool:* ⚡ Relaxed Mode (Allow print statements, rapid I/O)

### 14. 🧠 Project Intelligence & CI Optimization (New!)
Warden now features a **"Discovery Canvas"** that creates a semantic map of your project to optimize CI performance.
*   **Semantic Mapping:** Automatically identifies modules (e.g., "Payment Service", "Auth Module") and assigns them **Risk Levels (P0-P3)**.
*   **Context-Aware CI:** During a PR scan, Warden uses this intelligence to decide which files need a "Deep LLM Audit" and which ones can be handled by fast, local rules.
*   **Zero Noise:** Automatically ignores Warden's internal meta-files and project artifacts, focusing purely on your business logic.
*   **One-Command Refresh:** Keep your project's "Intelligence" up to date with `warden refresh`.

## 🏁 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install warden-core
```

### Initialization (The Critical Step)

To setup Warden for your project and **configure your AI Agent**:

```bash
warden init --agent
```

This command:
1.  Analyzes your project structure.
2.  Creates `.warden/AI_RULES.md`.
3.  Configures Claude Code hooks (`.claude/settings.json`) to auto-load rules.
4.  Sets up MCP configuration.
5.  Creates `.env` and `.env.example` for your API keys.

### The "Verify-Loop" Protocol

AI Agents working in a Warden project follow this strict protocol:

1.  **PLAN:** Design the change (Task or Phase).
2.  **EXECUTE:** Implement the code.
3.  **VERIFY:** Run `warden scan` at the end of the task/phase.
    *   **IF PASS:** Display **Quality Score (X/10)** 🚀
    *   **IF FAIL:** Fix issues and Repeat.

## 🛠️ Command Reference

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `warden scan` | Runs the full validation pipeline on the project. |
| `warden scan --diff` | **(New!)** Incremental scan. Checks only files changed relative to main branch. |
| `warden scan --diff --baseline` | **(New!)** Smart Autopilot. Uses baseline to hide legacy issues. |
| `warden validate <file>` | Scans a single file for immediate feedback. |
| `warden serve` | Starts the MCP Server for AI integration. |
| `warden doctor` | Checks project health and configuration status. |
| `warden install` | Installs/Updates validation frames. |
| `warden search <query>` | Searches Warden Hub or local codebase. |

### ⚡ Incremental Scanning (The Speed Force)
Don't wait hours for a full scan. Use **Diff Mode** to check only your recent changes:

```bash
# Checks changes relative to 'main' (staged + unstaged)
warden scan --diff

# Checks changes relative to a specific branch
warden scan --diff --base origin/develop
```

> **Result:** Scans finish in seconds, providing "Deep Scan" quality for just the code you touched.

### 🤖 Smart Baseline Autopilot (Delta Analysis)
Stop fighting legacy code. The **Smart Baseline Autopilot** ensures you only see *new* issues introduced in your current task, automatically suppressing existing "Legacy Debt".

#### How it Works:
1.  **Baseline Generation:** CI/CD generates a `baseline.json` (the "Known Good" state) on every merge to `main`.
2.  **Auto-Fetch:** When you run a scan, Warden automatically fetches the latest baseline from your repository or cloud storage.
3.  **Delta Filtering:** Warden compares findings against the baseline using **Semantic Hashing**. If a finding already exists in the baseline, it is hidden from the report.

#### Configuration (`.warden/config.yaml`):
```yaml
baseline:
  enabled: true
  path: .warden/baseline.json
  auto_fetch: true
  # Vendor-agnostic fetch command (GitHub, GitLab, S3, etc.)
  fetch_command: "gh run download -n warden-baseline" 
```

#### CLI Usage:
```bash
# Automatically applies baseline filtering
warden scan --diff
```

## 🧩 Architecture

Warden is designed with modular "Frames" and extends easily:

*   **Pipes & Filters:** Sequential execution pipeline.
*   **Priority Groups:** Critical security checks run first (Fail-Fast).
*   **LSP Synergy:** Uses Language Server Protocol for deep code understanding.
*   **Vector Search & Memory:** Semantic search for context-aware fixes and specialized "Project Purpose" memory.

### 🏆 The Hybrid Guardian Identity

Warden stands out by being a **Hybrid Architecture Guardian**. Unlike cloud-only review bots that rely heavily on PR context and SaaS infrastructure, Warden is designed as a **Privacy-First, Local-First** sentinel.

| Feature | ☁️ Traditional Cloud Bot | 🛡️ Warden Core (The Guardian) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Execution** | Cloud SaaS Only | **Local + CI/CD + Cloud** |
| **Privacy** | Code leaves your machine | **100% Local Processing** (LLM is optional/configurable) |
| **Context** | Pull Request & Tickets | **Project Purpose & Architecture Graph** |
| **Deep Scan** | Full Sandbox Build | **Dependency Graph & Impact Analysis** |
| **Memory** | Vector DB (SaaS) | **Local Vector DB + Knowledge Graph** |
| **Cost** | Per-Token / User | **Optimized (Qwen Fast Tier + Deterministic Rules First)** |

#### 🔑 Key Differentiators

1.  **Project Purpose Detector (Intent Analysis):**
    Typical cloud bots deduce intent from Jira/Linear tickets. Warden deduces it **directly from your code**. It analyzes your codebase to understand if it's a "Crypto Wallet" or "E-Commerce API" and adjusts its rules accordingly.

2.  **Architectural Frames:**
    We don't just look for bugs. We look for **Architectural Crimes**.
    *   *Did the Domain layer import Infrastructure?*
    *   *Is the code strictly following Clean Architecture?*
    *   *Are we drifting from the established design patterns?*

3.  **Active Memory (The "Brain"):**
    Warden doesn't just scan; it **remembers**.
    *   **Semantic Hashing:** Ignores whitespace/comment changes to avoid re-scanning.
    *   **Knowledge Graph:** Stores "Facts" about your project (e.g., "This project uses `pydantic` v2").
    *   **Vector Search:** (Roadmap) Retrieving similar historical code blocks to guide valid fixes.

#### 🧬 Anatomy of the Guardian

*   **🧠 The Brain (Project Context):** Does not just lint; it *understands* (e.g., "This is a Crypto Wallet, so security is paramount").
*   **👀 The Eyes (DependencyGraph):** Sees the "Butterfly Effect" — how a change in `utils.py` breaks `api.py`.
*   **📚 The Memory (Vector DB):** Recalls historical context and similar code patterns (Active Retrieval capabilities).
*   **⚡ The Reflexes (Semantic Hashing):** Ignores noise (whitespace, comments) to focus purely on meaningful logic.

> **The Philosophy:** Warden is not a "Reviewer" that you wait for; it is a **Guardian** that stands at the gate of your repo, ensuring quality *before* commitment.
