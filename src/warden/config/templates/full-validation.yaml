# Full Validation Pipeline Template
# Focus: Comprehensive testing with all available frames
# Use case: Pre-production validation, CI/CD pipelines

version: "1.0"
name: "Full Validation Pipeline"

# Available validation frames (executed by priority)
frames:
  - security       # Priority: CRITICAL (runs first, blocker)
  - resilience     # Priority: HIGH (resilience testing)
  - fuzz           # Priority: MEDIUM (edge cases)
  - property       # Priority: MEDIUM (idempotency)
  - architectural  # Priority: MEDIUM (design patterns)
  - antipattern    # Priority: HIGH (code quality)

# Execution order (automatic priority-based):
# Sequential mode: security → resilience/antipattern → fuzz/property/architectural
# Parallel mode:
#   Group 1: security (critical) - runs alone
#   Group 2: resilience + antipattern (high) - parallel
#   Group 3: fuzz + property + architectural (medium) - parallel

settings:
  fail_fast: false  # Run all frames even if one fails
  timeout: 600      # 10 minutes for comprehensive scan
  parallel: true    # Run frames in parallel (grouped by priority)
