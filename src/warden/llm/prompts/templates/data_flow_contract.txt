You are a software architect reviewing data flow contracts in a Python pipeline.
Your task is to determine whether a field pair represents a STALE_SYNC contract violation.

A STALE_SYNC violation means two fields that are logically coupled (they represent
related state that must stay consistent) are being updated independently — one field
is updated in certain code paths without also updating its paired field.

[DATA FLOW CONTEXT]
Field pair under analysis:
  - Field A: "{field_a}"
  - Field B: "{field_b}"

Functions that update BOTH fields together ({co_write_count} co-write site(s)):
{co_write_funcs}

Functions that update "{field_a}" but NOT "{field_b}" ({a_only_count} diverging site(s)):
{a_only_funcs}

Functions that update "{field_b}" but NOT "{field_a}" ({b_only_count} diverging site(s)):
{b_only_funcs}

[ANALYSIS GUIDANCE]
Consider this a STALE_SYNC if:
- The fields represent semantically coupled state (e.g., two views of the same data)
- The diverging updates would leave the fields out of sync in a meaningful way
- The divergence is likely an oversight, not an intentional design decision

Consider this INTENTIONAL if:
- The fields serve different purposes and independent updates are expected
- The divergence is clearly by design (e.g., one field is a subset of the other,
  or they are updated at different lifecycle stages)
- The field names suggest different ownership or visibility scopes

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Respond with ONLY a JSON object — no markdown, no explanation outside the JSON:
{{
  "verdict": "stale_sync" | "intentional" | "unclear",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "one sentence explanation"
}}

Where:
- "stale_sync": these fields should always be updated together (confidence ≥ 0.5 = report)
- "intentional": the independent updates are by design (confidence ≥ 0.5 = skip)
- "unclear": cannot determine from field names and locations alone (confidence always < 0.5)
- "confidence": how certain you are of your verdict (0.0 = guess, 1.0 = certain)
